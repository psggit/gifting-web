      <u>Personally Identifiable Information (or “PII”)</u>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
      Personally Identifiable Information (or “PII”) means and includes
      information that identifies You as an individual. In order for You to take
      advantage of benefits provided through the Website and/or App (for example,
      to use the Services offered on the Website and/or App), we may require that
      You furnish certain PII. For example, we may ask You to complete a
      registration form that asks for contact information such as Your name, date
      of birth, telephone / mobile number, and email address or an order form
      that asks for financial information like Your credit card number,
      expiration date, security code / CVV number and billing address. Your PII
      may also be obtained by us during the KYC process, which is to be used for
      Aadhaar Authentication Services to be provided by us, in order to verify
      Your identity and age.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      For enabling You to make payments using our Services, we may, upon Your
      consent, store Your financial information such as details of Your bank
      account (including but not limited to, the account holder’s name, account
      name, account number, sort code, online banking PIN, transaction
      authentication number) or details mentioned on Your credit or debit cards
      or other payment instruments, that are required for a successful
      transaction. Note that at no point in time will Your security code / CVV
      number of Your credit card be stored by HipBar or its payment gateway. We
      will ensure that Your PII which You have shared with us, including Your
      bank details, are kept safe and not shared with any third parties (except
      as required for the purpose of completing a transaction initiated by You on
      our Website and/or App),without Your consent.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      Additionally, when You transact on the Website and/or App, we may collect
      certain consumer information (such as products ordered and relevant
      promotion codes) If You communicate with us by email, or otherwise complete
      online forms, surveys, or contest entries, any information provided in such
      communication may be collected as PII. You may choose not to provide us
      with certain personal information. In such an event, You can still access
      and view much of the Website and/or App; however, You may not be able to
      reserve any products. In addition, You can choose not to provide certain
      optional information, but then You might not be able to take full advantage
      of many of the features on the Website and/or App.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      <u>Non-Personally Identifiable Information (or “Non-PII”)</u>
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
      Non-Personally Identifiable Information (or “Non-PII”) is aggregated
      information, demographic information and any other information that does
      not reveal Your specific identity. Through Analytics, this could include
      Advertising Features including Demographics &amp; Interest reporting,
      Remarketing, GDN Impression Reporting and Campaign Manager Integration. We
      and our third-party service providers may collect Your Non-PII, including
      information about the device You are using in accessing and/or using the
      Website and/or App, information from referring websites, and Your
      interaction with the Website and/or App. We and our third-party service
      providers also may aggregate PII in a manner such that the end-product does
      not personally identify You or any other user of the Website and/or App,
      for example, by using PII to calculate the percentage of our users who have
      a common telephone area code.

      Except as expressly set forth herein, this Privacy Policy does not address,
      and neither we nor our third party service providers are responsible for
      the privacy, information or other practices of other websites and/or any

      data transmission over the Internet or data storage system can be
      guaranteed to be 100% secure. Please do not send us sensitive information
      through email. If You have reason to believe that Your interaction with us
      is not secure (for example, if You feel that the security of any account
      You might have with us has been compromised), You must immediately notify
      us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the “Contacting Us”
      section below. (Note that if You choose to notify us via physical mail,
      this will delay the time it takes for us to respond to the problem.)
