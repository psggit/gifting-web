          <p class="paragraph-7">We at HipBar (“Hip Bar Private Limited”) value our customers, the network partners and assure them of a sincere and transparent service at all times. We understand the need and responsibility for technology driven businesses like HipBar to constantly evolve and improve the business practices to meet customer expectations. We take pride in keeping our customers at the center of all our activities. Despite our best intentions there is a possibility that there could be an inadvertent slippage in service quality due<br> to the ‘human’ element involved in the delivery of service.<br>
            <br> As a service organization, we promote &quot;Excellence in Delivery&quot; and therefore customer feedback forms an integral part of our improvement as an organization. The feedback provided by our customers is taken seriously, evaluated and adopted to improve our internal processes and training..<br>
            <br> This policy document aims at communicating the various redressal mechanisms available to our customers, our service guarantee and redressal timelines.<br>
            <br> Customer Service Principles<br>
            <br> HipBar’s policy on grievance redressal follows the below principles.<br>
            <br> ●     Customers are the centre of all initiatives and strategies developed at HipBar<br>
            <br> ●     HipBar will take care of all complaints in a fair and efficient manner<br>
            <br> ●     &quot;Delighted&quot; customers are a necessity for business growth and survival<br>
            <br> ●     HipBar promises to resolve any or all issues faced by our customers effectively and within the communicated time frame<br>
            <br> ●     HipBar has a dedicated Customer Engagement Centre under the Customer Service Department (CSD) to manage customer queries and resolve grievances.<br>
            <br>The Customers can send in their Queries, Requests or Complaints in the following ways:<br>

            <br> These mechanisms are dedicated to redressing customer complaints, providing instant online resolution wherever possible, and capturing customer feedback. <br>
            <br> On receiving customer feedback, our executives will reach out to the concerned customers and ensure that all grievances are addressed as per the pre-defined Service Level Agreement communicated below.</p><img src="/images/Asset-24x-8.png" width="336" srcset="/images/Asset-24x-8-p-500.png 500w, /images/Asset-24x-8.png 1523w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 336px" class="image-50"></div>
