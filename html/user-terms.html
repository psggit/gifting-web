            Our Services enable You to search and pay for various Products with the
            Merchant. All transactions are solely made between You and the Merchant.
            You acknowledge and agree we do not sell, offer to sell, invite to sell,
            sell or deliver the Products. In all instances, all sales are advertised,
            accepted, made and delivered by the Merchants who receive all orders and
            offers.
            <br />
            <br />
            HipBar grants you a non-transferable, non-exclusive limited license to

            which shall be subject to the terms and conditions contained in this

            HipBar Applications related to the Services on a mobile device that You own
            or control for Your personal non-commercial use. HipBar’s grant of the
            license does not permit You to duplicate, transfer, give access to, copy or
            distribute any part of the Services in any way, or use the Services in any
            manner not consistent with the terms of this Agreement. All rights not
            expressly granted herein are reserved by HipBar.
            <br />
            <br />
            4. Processing and Delivery of Products
            <br />
            <br />
            All Users are required to create a HipBar Wallet account (as defined
            hereinafter) and all payments in respect of the Products are to be made
            exclusively through the HipBar Wallet, the monetary value of which will be
            received by the respective Merchants from whom you purchase the Products.
            At the time you perform a transaction, your HipBar Wallet will be
            loaded/reloaded through a third party payment gateway, which will, subject
            to the terms and conditions agreed with the payment gateway, transfer and
            deliver the funds to the Merchant. The use of the HipBar Wallet shall be
            governed by the "HipBar Wallet - Terms of Use" which is accessible <a
                href="https://gifting.hipbar.com/hipbar-wallet">here
            </a>. The sale of the
            relevant Products shall be deemed to be completed at the licensed premises
            as per Applicable Laws.
            <br />
            <br />
            Before handing over of the Products to You, the Merchant may validate your
            identity by requesting a proof of identity. The onus of age-verification
            lies with the Merchant to request for a proof of identity if the recipient
            appears to be below the legal drinking age of the state of operation.
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            With regard to value of the PPI, HipBar follows industry practice, by
            rounding off the value to the nearest Rupee (i.e. if the MRP of a product
            in the decimal point has fractions of less than 50 paise, it is ignored,
            and in the case of fractions more than 50 paise, they are rounded off to
            the nearest higher Rupee)
        </p>
        <p dir="ltr">
            Neither HipBar, nor any officer, director, employee, shareholder or agent
            of HipBar shall be liable to the User or any third party for any claims
            relating to the reservation and/or consumption of the Products or any
            consequences which may result thereof.
            <br />
            <br />
            By completing a transaction on the HipBar Application, you agree that you
            are of the relevant legal age as per Applicable Law in the State in which
            you are domiciled, to reserve and thereafter consume such Products.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the event that there is no individual who is of the relevant legal age
            or other requirements as per Applicable Laws in the State in which he is
            domiciled, to receive and consume such Products or such individual cannot
            provide valid identification showing the proof of his or her age or other
            excise prerequisites such as “permit”, the Merchant may deny service of the
            Products. This reservation includes, but is not limited to the following:
            <br />
            <br />
